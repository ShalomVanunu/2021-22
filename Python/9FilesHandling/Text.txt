(CNN)Demoralized Democrats need a reckoning after a rough election night that sent serious warning signs that they have 
misjudged the nation's mood as their window closes before next year's midterms.


While the party feuds over its vast social spending agenda, Republicans are highlighting issues that preoccupy voters more 
immediately, like a sluggish economy, high gas prices, expensive groceries, crime rates and concerns about the rights of 
parents to influence what is taught in schools. Those concerns in many cases have been exacerbated by a prolonged pandemic, 
which President Joe Biden declared all but over in July but that spiked over the summer in a new blow to an exhausted nation's 
morale.
